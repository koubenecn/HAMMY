            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The HAMMY game is designed to instruct young learners grades 3-6 on the fundamentals of amateur radio required for licensure as a technician. The lesson plan calls for a gamified lesson design contained within a 2D game to help maintain young learners’ attention, establish flow, and provide instantaneous feedback.</p>
            
            <p>The intent of this project is to provide a 2-D game based application which will allow young learners to learn the basic principles required to pass the technician level amateur radio exam. Well these exams are designed primarily for older learners, They are occasionally taken and passed by learners as young as seven years old. The amateur radio community has developed a number of training aides, curriculum, and other tools designed to help testees gain their certification; however, few to none of these are designed for young learners.</p>

            <h2>The Content</h2>
<p>Content and objectives are based on the ARRL Ham Radio License Manual 4th Edition as well as the ARRL technician exam question pool. For “list of options”-type questions, options will be taken directly from the ARRL question pool.</p>
            
            <p>The player character must interact with in-game materials and objects as well as non-player characters to solve a series of challenges designed to incorporate Ham radio concepts. All challenges are focused on helping the player character establish simulated in-game radio contact with an NPC to solve a neighborhood mystery.</p>
